# About Pharns

GRC engineer, cloud security practitioner, and AAM cybersecurity specialist. I build and secure systems end-to-end: cloud governance frameworks, compliance automation, endpoint hardening, detection tuning, and evidence-ready workflows.

Rare hybrid: GRC discipline meets RF/aviation security and cyber-physical systems expertise. Production hardening experience, wireless/RF security research, USPTO patent holder. Service-disabled veteran (USAF) and FAA Part 107 certified.

Evidence-first methodology (controls, logs, screenshots), plain-English reporting, AI-assisted with human review, rapid iterations and clear handoffs.

**Credentials:** WGU B.S. Cybersecurity (Dec 2025) · Security+/Net+/A+ · ITIL4 · ISC² CC/SSCP (Assoc.) · LPI · FAA Part 107 · HAM/GMRS
**Scheduled:** CySA+/PenTest+ (Dec 2025) · AWS CP (Q1 2026)

## What I deliver (GRC focus)

**Cloud governance & control implementation:**
- AWS Control Pack: S3 default-deny, GuardDuty findings export with scoped IAM, CIS/NIST mapping — architecture designed, implementation Q1 2026.
- IAM least privilege, logging foundations, secure defaults with audit trails.

**Compliance automation & evidence:**
- GIAP™ governance automation: structured intake workflows with consent management, retention policies, and control mapping.
- Windows 11 PCI-DSS hardening with evidence pack delivered in under 48 hours.
- Baseline Evidence Drop: agentless Windows evidence collector with hashes and manifest.

**Detection engineering & systems:**
- Detection/IR lab with Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex, custom SIEM rules, and authored detections.
- TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry pipeline: evidence-grade wireless surveillance detection with logging architecture.
- Built and secured multi-component stacks (Proxmox, Nextcloud, Nginx reverse proxy, SuiteCRM + remote MySQL, SMTP/DNS/certs) with hardened access.

**AI-augmented delivery:**
- Multi-agent LLM workflows for policy drafting, control mapping, detection tuning, and documentation generation.
- 10× execution velocity on complex projects that typically require teams.

## Open to roles

**Primary focus (what I'm targeting):**

- GRC Engineer (technical implementation)
- Cloud Security Engineer (compliance/governance focus)
- Security Controls Implementation Specialist
- Detection Engineer

**Specialized depth (differentiators, not distractions):**

- AAM/UAV Security — hands-on drone engineering + security
- RF/Wireless Security — SDR, spectrum analysis, TraceLock™
- Cyber-Physical Systems — hardware + software security integration

**Growth trajectory:**

- Penetration Testing · Offensive Security (active lab, CySA+/PenTest+ Dec 2025)

Remote-first; open to international collaboration (US/EU/LatAm time zones) and relocation for the right opportunity.

## Why AI-augmented engineering matters for GRC

Traditional GRC work is documentation-heavy: control matrices, policy drafting, evidence collection, runbooks. I use multi-agent LLM workflows to:
- Draft policy and control mapping 5-10× faster with human review
- Generate evidence documentation from logs/screenshots automatically
- Produce audit-ready runbooks with consistent formatting
- Maintain living documentation that evolves with infrastructure

**Result:** Same rigor and quality as traditional approaches, delivered in hours instead of weeks. More time for high-value work: architecture, implementation, and validation.

## Rare combination

Most GRC engineers focus on policy and documentation. I implement the technical controls being documented:
- **GRC discipline:** Frameworks (NIST, CIS, PCI-DSS), evidence collection, control matrices
- **Cloud security:** AWS IAM/GuardDuty/CloudTrail, secure defaults, logging pipelines
- **Systems engineering:** Endpoint hardening, network segmentation, access controls
- **Detection & telemetry:** SIEM tuning, RF/wireless detection, evidence logging
- **AI acceleration:** Multi-agent workflows for compliance content generation

This combination enables me to audit, design, implement, and document security controls — not just check boxes.

## AAM cybersecurity: from builder to defender

I don't just study drone security — I've designed, built, and fielded operational UAV systems.

**Hands-on engineering background:**

- Designed and deployed small UAS (SUAS) for real-world missions, including beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) operations
- Developed swarm-deployable payload systems with custom avionics integration
- Authored USPTO patents for UAV delivery and payload mechanisms
- Built RF telemetry and command/control systems from the ground up

**Why this matters for cybersecurity:**

When I assess drone security, I understand the attack surface from the inside: firmware vulnerabilities, RF link exploitation, GPS spoofing vectors, and payload tampering. This operational experience — combined with SDR/RF research (TraceLock™) and FAA Part 107 certification — positions me to secure the systems I once built.

**Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)** is an emerging domain where few practitioners have both engineering depth and security discipline. I bring both.
