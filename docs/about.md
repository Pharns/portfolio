# 👋 **About Me**

## 🔐 **Who I Am**
Career rooted in UAV design, payload systems, and RF research, including leadership of a drone company while serving as system administrator for IT infrastructure, employee accounts, and operational security. Experience running production deployments of SuiteCRM, Docuseal, Nextcloud, Wiki.js, and SearXNG developed strengths in Linux system administration, identity & access management (IAM), and security hardening.  

This foundation now drives a transition into cybersecurity engineering and threat defense, combining homelab experimentation, wireless security research, and ongoing study toward a B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance (WGU).
