# About Pharns

I design and secure systems end-to-end: cloud guardrails, endpoint hardening, detection tuning, and evidence-ready workflows. I blend RF/SDR research, SOC-style detection work, and Python automation with a patented UAV background to deliver fast, auditable results.

**Who I am:** Security engineer and GRC practitioner with production hardening experience and a patented UAV payload background; service-disabled veteran and FAA Part 107.  
**How I work:** Evidence-first (controls, logs, screenshots), plain-English reporting, AI-assisted with human review, rapid iterations and clear handoffs.  
**Signals:** WGU B.S. Cybersecurity (Dec 2025), Security+/Net+/A+, ITIL4, ISC² CC/SSCP (Assoc.), LPI, FAA Part 107, HAM/GMRS; AWS CP/CySA+/Pentest+ scheduled Dec 2025.  
**Leadership & discipline:** Led AAM Cyber client work; disciplined execution shaped by high-stakes military environments.  

**What I deliver (examples):**
- Cloud guardrails and evidence export stood up in hours, with narrow IAM and compliance mapping.
- Windows 11 hardening with audit pack in under 48 hours.
- Detection tuning and IR drills with reduced false positives and documented playbooks.

**Open to roles:** Security Engineer, Security Compliance/Automation, Detection/Threat Hunter, RF/UAS/Wireless Security Engineer, Cloud Security Engineer, GRC Engineer/Analyst. Remote-first; open to international collaboration and relocation.
