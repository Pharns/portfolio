# About Pharns

I build and secure systems end-to-end: cloud governance frameworks, GRC automation, endpoint hardening, detection tuning, and evidence-ready workflows. Rare hybrid: GRC discipline meets RF/aviation security and cyber-physical systems expertise. I blend compliance discipline, AI-augmented engineering, and hands-on technical depth (cloud, RF/SDR, detection) with a patented UAV background to deliver fast, audit-ready results.

**Who I am:** GRC engineer, cloud security practitioner, and AAM cybersecurity specialist. Production hardening experience, wireless/RF security expertise, USPTO patent holder. Service-disabled veteran and FAA Part 107 certified.

**How I work:** Evidence-first (controls, logs, screenshots), plain-English reporting, AI-assisted with human review, rapid iterations and clear handoffs.

**Signals:** WGU B.S. Cybersecurity (Dec 2025), Security+/Net+/A+, ITIL4, ISC² CC/SSCP (Assoc.), LPI, FAA Part 107, HAM/GMRS; CySA+/PenTest+ scheduled Dec 2025; AWS CP planned Q1 2026.

**Trust signals:**

- Service-disabled veteran (USAF) — security clearance eligible
- Patent holder in UAV systems — demonstrates innovation and IP ownership
- Active GitHub with public project repos — code is verifiable
- Credly-verified certifications — [View badges](https://www.credly.com/users/pharns)

**Leadership & discipline:** Led AAM Cyber and USOG client work; built governance and safety controls. Disciplined execution shaped by high-stakes USAF aeromedical operations.

## What I deliver (GRC focus)

**Cloud governance & control implementation:**
- AWS Control Pack: S3 default-deny, GuardDuty findings export with scoped IAM, CIS/NIST mapping — architecture designed, implementation Q1 2026.
- IAM least privilege, logging foundations, secure defaults with audit trails.

**Compliance automation & evidence:**
- GIAP™ governance automation: structured intake workflows with consent management, retention policies, and control mapping.
- Windows 11 PCI-DSS hardening with evidence pack delivered in under 48 hours.
- Baseline Evidence Drop: agentless Windows evidence collector with hashes and manifest.

**Detection engineering & systems:**
- Detection/IR lab with Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex, custom SIEM rules, and authored detections.
- TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry pipeline: evidence-grade wireless surveillance detection with logging architecture.
- Built and secured multi-component stacks (Proxmox, Nextcloud, Nginx reverse proxy, SuiteCRM + remote MySQL, SMTP/DNS/certs) with hardened access.

**AI-augmented delivery:**
- Multi-agent LLM workflows for policy drafting, control mapping, detection tuning, and documentation generation.
- 10× execution velocity on complex projects that typically require teams.

## Why AI-augmented engineering matters for GRC

Traditional GRC work is documentation-heavy: control matrices, policy drafting, evidence collection, runbooks. I use multi-agent LLM workflows to:
- Draft policy and control mapping 5-10× faster with human review
- Generate evidence documentation from logs/screenshots automatically
- Produce audit-ready runbooks with consistent formatting
- Maintain living documentation that evolves with infrastructure

**Result:** Same rigor and quality as traditional approaches, delivered in hours instead of weeks. More time for high-value work: architecture, implementation, and validation.

## Rare combination

Most GRC engineers focus on policy and documentation. I implement the technical controls being documented:
- **GRC discipline:** Frameworks (NIST, CIS, PCI-DSS), evidence collection, control matrices
- **Cloud security:** AWS IAM/GuardDuty/CloudTrail, secure defaults, logging pipelines
- **Systems engineering:** Endpoint hardening, network segmentation, access controls
- **Detection & telemetry:** SIEM tuning, RF/wireless detection, evidence logging
- **AI acceleration:** Multi-agent workflows for compliance content generation

This combination enables me to audit, design, implement, and document security controls — not just check boxes.
