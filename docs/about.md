### USOG — CEO & Systems Administrator
*2018 – 2025 · Drone Logistics & Operations (Winding Down)*

Led $5.6M revenue drone logistics company with 18 employees. As a startup, served as both executive and hands-on sysadmin — built the entire IT security infrastructure from a single email address to production-grade systems:

- **Built enterprise infrastructure from scratch** — Self-hosted email, file storage (Nextcloud), remote access, backup systems, and security monitoring
- **Implemented CIS Controls v8 (IG1-IG2)** — Mapped security baseline to NIST CSF and SOC 2 trust criteria
- **Managed vulnerability remediation** — 15,000+ issues identified and resolved across multi-year infrastructure
- **Deployed security stack** — Dark web monitoring, threat intelligence feeds, endpoint protection, access controls
- **Maintained compliance posture** — Documentation, evidence collection, and audit-ready configurations

This wasn't delegated — I architected, deployed, hardened, and maintained every system. Real-world GRC implementation at scale.

*Currently winding down operations; transitioning fully to cybersecurity.*

### United States Air Force — Aeromedical Evacuation Technician
*1990 – 2007 · 18 Years Active Duty*

Flight nurse with mission-critical operations experience:

- High-pressure medical operations with strict protocols and documentation
- Security clearance experience (eligible for reinstatement)
- Disciplined execution in life-safety environments
- Service-disabled veteran status

### MiraCosta College — Adjunct Educator
*UAS/Drone Technology*

Taught drone technology courses, demonstrating communication skills and subject matter expertise in aviation systems.

## Career journey: Mission-critical → Builder → Defender

**Each phase built capabilities that compound in cybersecurity:**

| Phase | Role | What I Learned | How It Applies |
|-------|------|----------------|----------------|
| **USAF (18 years)** | Aeromedical Evacuation | Mission-critical operations, protocols, documentation, clearance experience | Disciplined execution, compliance mindset, audit culture |
| **USOG (7 years)** | CEO + Sysadmin | Built IT infrastructure for $5.6M company from scratch | Hands-on implementation, vulnerability management, production security |
| **AAM Cyber (current)** | GRC Consultant | Client delivery across HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2 | Framework expertise, evidence pipelines, compliance automation |

**The thread:** I've operated in environments where failure has consequences — medical missions, business operations, client compliance. That operational discipline carries into how I approach security: systematic, documented, evidence-ready.

**What this means for hiring managers:** I'm not learning on the job. I've managed production systems, delivered under deadlines, and maintained compliance across years of operations. The cybersecurity certifications formalize experience I already have.

## What I deliver (GRC focus)

**Cloud governance & control implementation:**
- AWS Control Pack: S3 default-deny, GuardDuty findings export with scoped IAM, CIS/NIST mapping — architecture designed, implementation Q1 2026.
- IAM least privilege, logging foundations, secure defaults with audit trails.

**Compliance automation & evidence:**
- GIAP™ governance automation: structured intake workflows with consent management, retention policies, and control mapping.
- Windows 11 PCI-DSS hardening with evidence pack delivered in under 48 hours.
- Baseline Evidence Drop: agentless Windows evidence collector with hashes and manifest.

**Detection engineering & systems:**
- Detection/IR lab with Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex, custom SIEM rules, and authored detections.
- TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry pipeline: evidence-grade wireless surveillance detection with logging architecture.
- Built and secured multi-component stacks (Proxmox, Nextcloud, Nginx reverse proxy, SuiteCRM + remote MySQL, SMTP/DNS/certs) with hardened access.

**AI-assisted delivery:**

## Open to roles

**Primary focus (what I'm targeting):**

- GRC Engineer (technical implementation)
- Cloud Security Engineer (compliance/governance focus)
- Security Controls Implementation Specialist
- Detection Engineer

**Specialized depth (differentiators, not distractions):**

- AAM/UAV Security — hands-on drone engineering + security
- RF/Wireless Security — SDR, spectrum analysis, TraceLock™
- Cyber-Physical Systems — hardware + software security integration

**Growth trajectory:**

- Penetration Testing · Offensive Security (active lab, CySA+/PenTest+ Jan 2026)

**Actively seeking international opportunities.** Remote-first with async collaboration experience across US/EU/LatAm time zones. Contractor/consulting available for non-US companies; visa sponsorship required for relocation.

---

## AI-assisted GRC workflows

Traditional GRC work is documentation-heavy: control matrices, policy drafting, evidence collection, runbooks. I use LLM tools to accelerate delivery:

- Draft policy and control mapping faster with thorough human review
- Generate structured evidence documentation from logs and screenshots
- Produce audit-ready runbooks with consistent formatting
- Maintain living documentation that evolves with infrastructure

**Result:** Same rigor and quality as traditional approaches, with faster turnaround. More time for high-value work: architecture, implementation, and validation.

---

## Rare combination

Where most GRC engineers stop at policy, I continue through implementation:
- **GRC discipline:** Frameworks (NIST, CIS, PCI-DSS), evidence collection, control matrices
- **Cloud security:** AWS IAM/GuardDuty/CloudTrail, secure defaults, logging pipelines
- **Systems engineering:** Endpoint hardening, network segmentation, access controls
- **Detection & telemetry:** SIEM tuning, RF/wireless detection, evidence logging
- **AI acceleration:** Multi-agent workflows for compliance content generation

This combination enables me to audit, design, implement, and document security controls — not just check boxes.

## AAM cybersecurity: from builder to defender

I don't just study drone security — I've designed, built, and fielded operational UAV systems.

**Hands-on engineering background:**

- Designed and deployed small UAS (SUAS) for real-world missions, including beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) operations
- Developed swarm-deployable payload systems with custom avionics integration
- Authored USPTO patents for UAV delivery and payload mechanisms
- Built RF telemetry and command/control systems from the ground up

**Why this matters for cybersecurity:**

When I assess drone security, I understand the attack surface from the inside: firmware vulnerabilities, RF link exploitation, GPS spoofing vectors, and payload tampering. This operational experience — combined with SDR/RF research (TraceLock™) and FAA Part 107 certification — positions me to secure the systems I once built.

**Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)** is an emerging domain where few practitioners have both engineering depth and security discipline. I bring both.
