# 👋 **About Me**

## 🔐 **Who I Am**
I’m Pharns — a cybersecurity professional in training with a foundation in UAV innovation, RF research, and system administration. My career began in UAV design and payload systems, where protecting intellectual property meant building secure, private infrastructure. Running production deployments of SuiteCRM, Docuseal, Nextcloud, Wiki.js, and SearXNG gave me hands-on experience with **Linux system administration, access control, and security hardening** in real-world environments.  

Today, I’m applying that technical foundation to **cybersecurity and threat defense**, combining homelab experimentation, wireless security research, and continuous learning toward my B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance at WGU.

## 🚀 **Hands-On Highlights**
- **Production System Administration** — Deployed and maintained SuiteCRM, Docuseal, Nextcloud, Wiki.js, and SearXNG in production, managing IAM, backups, monitoring, and security hardening to safeguard sensitive IP  
- **Homelab Engineering** — Proxmox-based lab with Security Onion, TheHive, and Nessus, simulating enterprise defense workflows (SIEM, IDS/IPS, SOC incident response)  
- **Zero Trust Pilot** — Tested Tailscale, Twingate, and Netbird to evaluate secure access management and IAM practices  
- **Offensive Security Toolkit** — Hands-on use of WiFi Pineapple, HackRF One, Flipper Zero, and Rubber Ducky for penetration testing, application security, and vulnerability assessment  
- **Drone & SDR Security Research** — Built UAV platforms with SDR penetration-testing payloads and modular 3D-printed housings for RF exploitation tools  
- **Ham Radio & Mesh Networking** — Licensed operator; deployed Meshtastic LoRa mesh to evaluate decentralized communications resilience  
- **Patented Drone Payload Systems** — Invented UAV payload architectures; additional patents pending integrating SDR for cyber applications
