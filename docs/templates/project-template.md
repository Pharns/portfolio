# 🔒 **[Project Title]**

Short intro (1–2 sentences) explaining the project’s purpose and how it fits into your cybersecurity learning or professional development.  
Example: *This project demonstrates my ability to perform vulnerability assessments using Nessus in a segmented lab environment, focusing on identifying, reporting, and mitigating security risks.*  

---

## 💡 **Key Features**
- **Objective:** What was the main goal of the project?  
- **Tools Used:** List key tools (e.g., Nessus, Kali Linux, Wireshark).  
- **Skills Practiced:** Vulnerability scanning, reporting, patch validation, etc.  
- **Value:** Why it matters (e.g., real-world skill relevance for SOC or security engineering roles).
