## Summary
AI-augmented Cloud/GRC and Detection Engineer who builds audit-ready cloud and hybrid stacks with evidence-first logging, IAM discipline, and automation. Delivers compliance-grade intake workflows, endpoint hardening, and cloud guardrails mapped to CIS/NIST. Veteran, FAA Part 107. Target: GRC Engineer / Cloud Compliance / Security Engineer roles.

## Core Skills
- **GRC & Controls:** CIS/NIST/ISO mappings, evidence pipelines, control attestation, intake/runbooks, retention, access reviews
- **Cloud & IAM:** S3 default-deny, GuardDuty exports, scoped IAM, TLS-only policies; Zero-WAN remote access (Tailscale/RustDesk)
- **Compliance Automation:** Intake portals (Nextcloud+n8n+SuiteCRM), manifest/hashes, control mapping, structured JSON for pipelines
- **Hardening & Endpoint:** PCI-DSS Windows lockdown (<48h), firewall/audit policy, EDR/AV validation, Secure Boot/BitLocker
- **Detection & Telemetry:** SOC/IR lab (Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex), authored detections with enrichment and FP tuning; RF/SDR telemetry (TraceLock™)
- **Tooling & Automation:** Python, systemd/cron, Markdown/Mermaid, multi-agent LLM workflows (design → policy → test → document)

## Projects (selected)
- **GIAP™ – GRC Intake Automation Platform:** Nextcloud+n8n+SuiteCRM with role matrix, retention, consent, TLS/email hardening; intake JSON for evidence pipelines; SOC2/NIST control mapping; evidence checklist and validation runbook.
- **Baseline Evidence Drop:** Consent-first, agentless Windows collector (BitLocker, Secure Boot, firewall, audit policy, EDR/AV, patches, listeners); manifest + hashes; control IDs (CIS/NIST/ISO); ready for GIAP intake.
- **Cloud Control Pack (AWS):** S3 default-deny baseline, GuardDuty → TLS-only S3 evidence export, scoped IAM with TLS-only denies; CIS/NIST mapping and validation checklist.
- **PCI DSS Endpoint Hardening (Win11):** <48h lockdown (encryption, EDR, outbound monitoring, audit view); CIS/NIST table; full evidence gallery.
- **Secure Intake & Evidence Portal (consulting, anonymized):** Role-based intake, retention, integrity checks, logged workflows; SOC2/NIST mapping; evidence checklist.
- **TraceLock™ (RF/SDR telemetry):** Multi-sensor pipeline (Wi-Fi/BLE/rtl_433/ADS-B) with AI-assisted parsing, detections, structured logs, and export; secure plumbing (parameterized DB, encrypted creds, validated ignore lists); CI smoke tests.

## Experience (highlights)
- Delivered GRC/hardening/remote-access engagements for small orgs and law firms (anonymized): intake portals, retention policies, access reviews, email/TLS hardening, IAM/backups/patch automation; produced audit-ready artifacts.
- Built and maintained SOC/IR lab; authored detections and enrichment; practiced FP tuning and playbooks.
- Developed TraceLock™ RF telemetry platform with evidence-grade logging; CI/smoke tests and secure coding patterns.

## Education & Certifications
- B.S. Cybersecurity & Information Assurance (WGU) — in progress (Dec 2025)
- CompTIA Security+; ISC² SSCP (Assoc.); ISC2 CC
- CompTIA CSIS, Network+, CIOS, A+, Project+, LPI Linux Essentials, ITIL Foundations
- Pending: AWS Cloud Practitioner; CySA+; PenTest+
- Licenses: FAA Part 107; HAM/GMRS
