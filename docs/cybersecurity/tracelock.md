# TraceLock — Signature Project (Public-Safe Placeholder)

**TL;DR:** RF/SDR telemetry and wireless situational awareness pipeline (Kismet, rtl_433, ADS-B) with AI-assisted parsing and evidence logging. Demonstrates RF security specialization, detection engineering, and AI-augmented workflows for high-signal roles.

_Update with sanitized specifics once provided._

## Overview
- Purpose (problem, users, environment)  
- Stack: data sources, analytics/detection layer, storage, reporting  
- Role: design, build, testing, tuning  

## Outcomes (fill with public-safe metrics)
- Detections authored; false-positive tuning notes  
- Time-to-detect or time-to-triage improvements  
- Automation wins (playbooks/scripts)  

## Evidence (sanitized)
- Architecture diagram (no internal endpoints)  
- Detection logic snippets or pseudo-Sigma (no secrets)  
- Screenshots of alerts/dashboards with redactions  
- Test data/replay approach (synthetic)
