# GIAP™ — Multi-Agent GRC Automation Platform
*Updated: {{ page.meta.git_revision_date_localized or "" }}*

!!! tldr "For recruiters & hiring managers"
    **What:** 7-agent GRC automation platform with AI/LLM integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Orchestrates client intake, CRM sync, legal document automation, cross-framework control mapping, POA&M generation, and remediation task creation. Two-phase workflow: CISO Assistant for rapid pre-engagement assessment, Eramba CE for full operational GRC.

    **Why this matters:** Demonstrates senior-level systems architecture, multi-agent orchestration, API-first design, and AI integration — the kind of automation that transforms manual GRC processes into scalable, audit-ready workflows.

    **Impact:** Reduces audit prep time by ~70% through natural language queries; automates end-to-end GRC lifecycle from intake to remediation tracking.

    **Skills:** Multi-Agent Architecture · MCP/LLM Integration · FastAPI · React · Eramba CE · CISO Assistant · GRC Automation · Control Mapping · SOC 2 · NIST CSF · CIS v8 · HIPAA · CPRA · Evidence Pipelines · API Design · RBAC · Audit Logging

!!! info "Project Status: Architecture Complete, Implementation Active"
    **Infrastructure:** Deployed — Multi-VM Proxmox stack with Eramba CE, CISO Assistant, Nextcloud, n8n, SuiteCRM, and DocuSeal.

    **Architecture:** Complete — 7-agent pipeline designed, MCP integration specified, API scaffolded.

    **Implementation:** Active — FastAPI backend and React frontend in development; agent integration in progress.

## End-to-End Workflow

GIAP™ implements a two-phase workflow with a clear **deposit gate** separating pre-engagement qualification from paid consulting work:

## POAMAgent — Custom POA&M Generator

No dedicated open-source POA&M generator exists. For a boutique consulting firm, custom tooling is the right choice:

| Approach | Cost | Integration | Portfolio Value |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Commercial (Onspring, etc.) | $5K-50K/year | Generic | None |
| **Custom POAMAgent** | Dev time only | Native GIAP | "Built production compliance tooling" |

### POAMAgent Capabilities

```python
# POAMAgent outputs
poam_agent = {
    "inputs": ["eramba_gaps", "aam_unified_controls", "client_context"],
    "outputs": {
        "executive_summary": "1-page risk overview (PDF)",
        "detailed_poam": "Full remediation plan with milestones (MD/CSV/PDF)",
        "eramba_import": "Task list for remediation tracking (JSON)"
    },
    "templates": "Jinja2 → Markdown → WeasyPrint PDF",
    "branding": "AAM Cyber deliverable format"
}
```

### Implementation Scope

| Component | Complexity | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Eramba API query | Low | Designed |
| Severity/priority logic | Low | Designed |
| Jinja2 templates | Low | Designed |
| PDF generation | Medium | Planned |
| Eramba task import | Low | Planned |

---

## MCP Integration

GIAP™ integrates with Claude and other AI assistants via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, enabling natural language queries against GRC data:

| MCP Server | Data Source | Phase | Example Queries |
|------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| `giap-crm` | SuiteCRM | Both | "Show all pending intakes" / "What's the engagement status for Client X?" |
| `giap-controls` | CISO Assistant | Pre | "Run a quick SOC 2 gap check for new prospect" / "What frameworks fit this client?" |
| `giap-risk` | Eramba CE | Post | "Show high-risk items for Client X" / "What's our overall risk posture?" |
| `giap-evidence` | Nextcloud | Post | "Show the signed NDA for Client X" / "What evidence is missing for CC6.1?" |
| `giap-poam` | GIAP Database | Post | "Generate a POA&M for Client X" / "What are the top 5 high-risk items?" |

### Example Conversation

```
User: New prospect came in — healthcare practice, 25 employees, M365 + on-prem EHR.
      Quick assessment before our sales call?

Claude: [Reads giap://controls/frameworks/hipaa/quick-assessment]
        [Reads giap://controls/frameworks/soc2/quick-assessment]

Quick Assessment for Healthcare Practice:

Recommended Frameworks: HIPAA (required), SOC 2 (recommended for vendors)

Likely Gaps (based on profile):
- §164.312(a) Access Control — EHR access reviews needed
- §164.308(a)(1) Risk Analysis — Likely missing formal risk assessment
- CC6.2 Logical Access — M365 MFA status unknown

Suggested Engagement: HIPAA Security Rule assessment + SOC 2 readiness
Estimated Scope: 40-60 hours

Ready to create intake in SuiteCRM?
```
