# 🛡️ **Vulnerability Assessment**

**TL;DR:** Vulnerability scan and fix plan using standard tools (Nessus/OpenVAS/Nmap). I find issues, rank them by business risk, and hand back clear, actionable remediation steps with evidence.

A hands-on demonstration of enterprise vulnerability management using industry-standard tools and structured methodologies. This project highlights the ability to identify, prioritize, and remediate security weaknesses — experience directly relevant to SOC operations, risk management, and compliance.
