# üöÄ **Homelab Build Journey: Building a Virtual Security Lab with Proxmox**

This page is a write-up of how I planned, built, and secured my homelab. It complements the [Homelab Infrastructure (Summary)](homelab-infrastructure.md) by documenting the full journey ‚Äî from hardware selection to ongoing improvements.  

---

## üéØ Purpose
This lab serves as my personal testing ground where I can safely:
- Experiment with security tools and configurations  
- Practice incident response scenarios  
- Learn new cybersecurity techniques  
- Test solutions before applying them in production  

---

## üìã **Planning Phase**
Just like in a professional deployment, I started with careful planning:  
- Researched the best hardware for my needs (settled on the Beelink SER5 Mini PC)  
- Created a checklist to avoid oversights  
- Designed for **security-first** from day one  
- Documented each step for repeatability

## üìù **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### 1. **Getting Started**
- Downloaded Proxmox VE from the official site  
- Verified SHA256 checksum for integrity  
- Validated GPG signatures  
- Created bootable media with Balena Etcher

### 2. **BIOS Setup**
- Accessed BIOS (Delete/F2/F10 on startup)  
- Enabled virtualization features (AMD-V)  
- Adjusted boot sequence for USB install  
- Saved hardened configuration

### 3. **Installation & Security**
- Installed Proxmox VE with strong admin credentials  
- Configured secure authentication defaults  
- Applied immediate post-install updates  

---

### 4. **Network Setup**
- Configured **pfSense firewall**  
- Created **VLAN segmentation** for isolation  
- Applied firewall rules for remote access  
- Added monitoring for visibility

### 5. **Ongoing Hardening**
- Applied rolling updates and patches  
- Introduced backup policies  
- Layered extra security controls over time

## üìà **Project Impact & Growth**

### üß† Key Learning Outcomes
- **Infrastructure Management** ‚Üí virtualization, monitoring, and secure administration  
- **Security Implementation** ‚Üí SOC deployment, vuln scanning, incident response  
- **Professional Development** ‚Üí documentation, problem-solving, project management  

---

### ‚≠ê Ongoing Improvements
- Adding advanced SOC integrations (SIEM, IDS tuning)  
- Expanding self-hosted services with automation (Ansible, CI/CD)  
- Optimizing performance monitoring and backups  

---

## üíº **Professional Applications**
This journey demonstrates practical ability to:  
- Build **secure and scalable infrastructures**  
- Deploy **enterprise-grade SOC tools** in a lab setting  
- Document and communicate technical processes clearly  
- Translate lab work into **real-world security operations skills**  

---

## üìå **Key Takeaway**
What began as a personal experiment matured into a **comprehensive homelab platform**. This project reflects my ability to plan, secure, and operate complex environments while documenting the journey with a professional, security-first mindset.
