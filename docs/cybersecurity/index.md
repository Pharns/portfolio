# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Focused on detection, hardening, and compliance automation with a wireless/RF edge.

## Featured Cases
- **PCI DSS Endpoint Hardening (Win11)** — Encryption, EDR, patch automation, outbound monitoring in <48 hours; includes controls matrix and screenshots.  
- **Detection & IR Lab** — Security Onion + TheHive/Cortex + Nessus on Proxmox; authored sample detections, ran incident drills, tuned IDS noise.  
- **Zero Trust Pilots** — Tailscale vs Twingate vs Netbird; IAM and device posture notes for small teams.  
- **RF/Wireless Security Research** — SDR + UAV payload tests; BLE/Sub-GHz recon; mitigations and safe-by-design notes.  

## TraceLock (signature project)
Placeholder until sanitized details are provided: summarize goal, stack, telemetry, detections, and outcomes. Include architecture sketch and 3–5 measurable results (no secrets).

## Additional Work
- Offensive toolkit evaluations (WiFi Pineapple, HackRF, Flipper, Rubber Ducky) with mitigations.  
- Compliance automation notes for NIST/ISO/PCI (evidence capture, scripting).  
- Homelab build and infrastructure notes for the SOC lab stack.
