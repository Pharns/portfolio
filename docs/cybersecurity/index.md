# 🛡 **Cybersecurity — Overview**

This section showcases **hands-on projects** that apply **industry-standard tools** and **real-world workflows** to build, secure, and test enterprise-grade environments.  
The work demonstrates practical capabilities in **cybersecurity engineering**, **SOC operations**, **vulnerability management**, **incident response**, and **regulatory compliance** — bridging academic knowledge with **applied, production-tested skills**.  

Projects include a **real-world PCI DSS compliance remediation** deployed in a mortgage environment, along with **Proxmox-based homelab systems**, **threat detection frameworks**, and **offensive security simulations** — each designed to reflect **enterprise security standards** and **professional-grade implementation**.
