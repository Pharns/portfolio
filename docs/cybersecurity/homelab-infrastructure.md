## 💡 **Core Features**
- Virtualization with **Proxmox VE** for agile deployment of VMs  
- **SOC Tools** → Security Onion, Wazuh, Nessus, TheHive + Cortex  
- **Red Team Tools** → Kali Linux, Metasploit, DVWA, Caldera  
- **Network Segmentation** → pfSense firewall with VLANs  
- **Zero Trust Pilot** → testing Tailscale, Twingate, Netbird  
- **Self-Hosted Services** → Nextcloud, n8n, Kasm Workspaces
