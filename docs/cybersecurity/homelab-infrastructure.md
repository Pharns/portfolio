# Homelab Infrastructure

**TL;DR:** Realistic “mini-SOC” lab: built and segmented a network, deployed monitoring tools (Security Onion/Wazuh/Nessus/TheHive), and tested Zero Trust access (Tailscale/Twingate/Netbird). Shows end-to-end security ops with plain-English notes for non-technical reviewers. Outcome: full lab stood up and documented in <3 days.

A Proxmox-based homelab designed as a practical testbed to build, break, and secure enterprise-like systems. This environment delivers **hands-on experience with the same tools and architectures used in modern SOCs and IT operations**. The following sections highlight key competencies developed and how they translate into professional value for an organization.

## 💡 **Core Features**
- **Virtualization** with Proxmox VE for agile deployment of VMs  
- **SOC Tools** → Security Onion, Wazuh, Nessus, TheHive + Cortex  
- **Red Team Tools** → Kali Linux, Metasploit, DVWA, Caldera  
- **Network Segmentation** → pfSense firewall with VLANs  
- **Zero Trust Pilot** → testing Tailscale, Twingate, Netbird  
- **Self-Hosted Services** → Nextcloud, n8n, Kasm Workspaces

## 🧩 **Key Competencies Developed**  
- **Infrastructure Management** → secure VM administration, system hardening, resource optimization  
- **Security Implementation** → SOC deployment, vulnerability scanning, and incident response  
- **Vulnerability Management** → identify and remediate weaknesses with enterprise-grade tools  
- **Zero Trust Principles** → applied in segmented networks using modern access control models  
- **Professional Skills** → leadership, mentoring, and disciplined execution under pressure, shaped by service as a USAF Veteran and corporate leadership experience

## 💼 **Professional Applications**  
The competencies gained through this homelab translate into measurable value for organizations:  
- **Resilient Infrastructure** → design and maintain secure, segmented environments that reduce attack surface  
- **Operational Security** → deploy SOC tools to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents effectively  
- **Continuous Vulnerability Management** → identify and remediate weaknesses before they impact business operations  
- **Zero Trust Implementation** → apply granular access controls and modern security models to safeguard systems and data
