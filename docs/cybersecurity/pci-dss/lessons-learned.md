# Lessons Learned

1. **Endpoint compliance matters** — PCI controls start at the workstation.
2. **Automation reduces drift** — Scheduled PowerShell verification prevents silent misconfigurations.
3. **Segmentation isn’t just for servers** — VLANs + always-on VPN create true isolation even in SMB networks.
4. **Documentation is evidence** — Structured Markdown + hash-verified logs meet audit expectations.
5. **Free tools can meet enterprise standards** — Security depends more on discipline than licensing.
