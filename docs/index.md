# **👋 Hi, I’m Pharns**

Cybersecurity specialist in training | UAV systems innovator (patented) | RF & SDR security | Emerging Python developer  

I bring a career in UAV design, payload systems, and drone delivery innovation — including running my own drone company, where I also acted as the system administrator responsible for IT infrastructure, employee accounts, and operational security.  

Building on this foundation, I’m now expanding into cybersecurity to apply my combined expertise in systems administration, wireless, RF, and UAV engineering to modern security challenges.  

This site is a recruiter-friendly snapshot of my cybersecurity projects, wireless/RF research, and Python development (WGU D335 + 100 Days). It demonstrates how I’m bridging two worlds: established UAV innovation and emerging cybersecurity expertise.
