# **ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pharns**

**Cybersecurity Specialist (in training) | RF & SDR Security | Emerging Python Developer | UAV Systems Innovator (Patented)**  

I bring a career in UAV design, payload systems, and drone delivery innovation â€” including running my own drone company, where I also acted as the system administrator responsible for IT infrastructure, employee accounts, and operational security.  

Building on this foundation, Iâ€™m now expanding into cybersecurity to apply my combined expertise in systems administration, wireless, RF, and UAV engineering to modern security challenges.
