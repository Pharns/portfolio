# **👋 Hi, I’m Pharns**

**AI-augmented Cloud/GRC & Detection Engineer** — targeting $110K–$150K (stretch $150K–$200K), remote-first (low-chaos hybrid OK). I blend cloud guardrails, PCI-DSS endpoint hardening, SOC/detection tuning, and RF/SDR telemetry (TraceLock), accelerated with multi-agent LLM workflows.

**Core signals:** Windows 11 PCI baseline with evidence pack · TraceLock RF/SDR telemetry + AI parsing · Proxmox/Security Onion + TheHive/Cortex lab · Tailscale/RustDesk zero-WAN remote access · Law-firm GRC intake/remediation · Part 107 & veteran

CTA: [TraceLock](cybersecurity/tracelock.md) · [Cloud/GRC controls](cybersecurity/aws-control-pack.md) · [PCI-DSS hardening](cybersecurity/pci-dss/index.md) · [Detection lab](cybersecurity/incident-response.md) · [Contact](contact.md)
