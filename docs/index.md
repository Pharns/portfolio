## Why hire me for GRC engineering

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**I implement the controls, not just document them.**

Most GRC professionals write policies and manage spreadsheets. I architect and build the technical systems that satisfy those controls:

- **Endpoint compliance** — Delivered PCI-DSS Windows 11 hardening (BitLocker, GPO, firewall rules, patch automation, EDR) with complete evidence pack in <48 hours for financial services client.

- **Compliance automation** — Deployed GIAP™ intake platform: CISO Assistant + n8n + Nextcloud + SuiteCRM on self-hosted Proxmox. RBAC, retention policies, consent management, and 100+ framework coverage.

- **Evidence pipelines** — Built audit-grade logging systems with structured schemas and evidence export workflows. Applied across cloud logs, access controls, and compliance data collection.

- **Detection & response** — Operate active Security Onion + TheHive/Cortex lab. Author SIEM rules, tune false positives, write IR playbooks. Understand security operations, not just governance.

- **Cloud governance** — Designing AWS Control Pack with S3 default-deny, GuardDuty export pipelines, scoped IAM roles, and CIS/NIST mapping.

- **AI-assisted workflows** — Use LLM tools for policy drafting, control mapping, and documentation generation with human review. Faster delivery without sacrificing rigor.

**Bottom line:** Hire me if you need someone who can design a control framework, implement the technical architecture, document everything with evidence, and hand auditors a clean package.

## Detection engineering & offensive security

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**Current capability:** Active detection/IR lab with Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex, custom SIEM rules, and authored detections. TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry demonstrates detection engineering fundamentals across 6 wireless domains.

**Growth trajectory:** CySA+ and PenTest+ scheduled January 2026. Building penetration testing portfolio through lab work and vulnerability assessments.

**Why this matters:** GRC engineers who understand offensive techniques write better controls. Detection experience informs what to log and monitor.

## AAM cybersecurity specialization

**I don't just secure drones — I've designed, built, and fielded UAV systems.**

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) security requires practitioners who understand the engineering, not just the vulnerabilities. I bring hands-on experience across the full lifecycle:

|------------|----------|
| **UAV Engineering** | Designed, built, and fielded operational UAV systems |
| **USPTO Patents** | Granted patents in UAV payload and delivery architectures |
| **RF Threat Detection** | TraceLock™ 6-domain correlation (Wi-Fi/BLE/SDR/GPS/ADS-B) — rogue APs, trackers, drone proximity |
| **Aviation Credentials** | FAA Part 107 certified drone pilot |
| **SDR/Wireless** | HackRF, RTL-SDR, Kismet — spectrum analysis and signal intelligence |
| **Consulting** | AAM Cyber, LLC — cyber-physical security services |
| **Military Aviation** | USAF aeromedical operations background |
