# **👋 Hi, I’m Pharns**

**AI-augmented Cloud Security, GRC, and Detection Engineer** — remote-first (low-chaos hybrid OK). I build audit-ready cloud and hybrid stacks with evidence-first logging, IAM discipline, RF/SDR telemetry, and automation.

**Role fit (for hiring managers/HR):** Cloud/GRC Engineer · Detection Engineer · RF/Wireless Security · Compliance & Hardening · Python automation. Veteran · FAA Part 107 · US-based. This portfolio is a companion to my resume—click into case studies for controls, evidence, and outcomes.
