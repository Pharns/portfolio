## ⚡ Why hire me for GRC engineering

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**I implement the controls, not just document them.**

Most GRC professionals write policies and manage spreadsheets. I architect and build the technical systems that satisfy those controls:

- **Cloud governance** — Built AWS Control Pack with S3 default-deny, GuardDuty export pipelines, scoped IAM roles, and CIS/NIST mapping. Can deploy production-ready cloud baselines in hours.

- **Endpoint compliance** — Delivered PCI-DSS Windows 11 hardening (BitLocker, GPO, firewall rules, patch automation, EDR) with complete evidence pack in <48 hours. Know how to actually secure endpoints, not just check boxes.

- **Compliance automation** — Architected GIAP™ intake platform: Nextcloud + n8n workflows + SuiteCRM with RBAC, retention policies, consent management, and structured JSON outputs. Automated what others do manually.

- **Evidence pipelines** — Built TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry system with audit-grade logging, structured schemas, and evidence export workflows. Same skills used for cloud logs, access controls, and compliance data.

- **Detection & response** — Operate active Security Onion + TheHive/Cortex lab. Author SIEM rules, tune false positives, write IR playbooks. Understand security operations, not just governance.

- **AI-augmented delivery** — Use multi-agent LLM workflows to draft policies, map controls, and generate documentation at 10× speed with human review. Deliver in hours what takes others weeks.

**Bottom line:** Hire me if you need someone who can design a control framework, implement the technical architecture, document everything with evidence, and hand auditors a clean package — all while working at AI-augmented velocity.

## 🧰 Full-stack GRC skill set

Unlike traditional GRC roles focused only on policy and documentation, I implement the technical controls being audited. This table shows the breadth of my GRC engineering capabilities:

## 🔧 Broader technical capabilities

While GRC engineering is my primary focus, I bring adjacent technical skills that add value to compliance and security roles:

<div class="stat-grid" markdown>
<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**Infrastructure & Homelab**
Built production-grade Proxmox environment with Security Onion, Kali, hardened self-hosted stack (Nextcloud, SuiteCRM, Wiki.js). Network segmentation, reverse proxy, remote access with zero WAN exposure.
<span class="tag-chip">Proxmox</span> <span class="tag-chip">Linux</span> <span class="tag-chip">Networking</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**Python Automation**
Evidence collection scripts, API integrations, data parsing, workflow automation. Used across GRC projects for intake automation, log analysis, and documentation generation.
<span class="tag-chip">Python</span> <span class="tag-chip">APIs</span> <span class="tag-chip">Scripting</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**RF & Wireless Security**
SDR/spectrum analysis (RTL-SDR, HackRF), Bluetooth/BLE security, Wi-Fi monitoring (Kismet), ADS-B telemetry. Unique niche expertise with GRC-relevant evidence logging skills.
<span class="tag-chip">SDR</span> <span class="tag-chip">RF</span> <span class="tag-chip">Wireless</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**Detection Engineering**
SIEM rule authoring (Security Onion), alert tuning, correlation logic, false positive reduction. Authored custom detections with enrichment and IR playbook integration.
<span class="tag-chip">SIEM</span> <span class="tag-chip">Detection</span> <span class="tag-chip">Alerts</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**DevOps & IaC**
Git version control, CI/CD basics, infrastructure-as-code concepts (Terraform/CloudFormation), containerization awareness. Applied to compliance automation and documentation workflows.
<span class="tag-chip">Git</span> <span class="tag-chip">IaC</span> <span class="tag-chip">Automation</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**Technical Writing & Documentation**
Markdown, diagrams-as-code, architecture documentation, runbook authoring, compliance narratives. Every project includes comprehensive docs designed for both technical and audit audiences.
<span class="tag-chip">Markdown</span> <span class="tag-chip">Diagrams</span> <span class="tag-chip">Docs</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**UAV & Innovation**
Patent holder in UAV payload systems. FAA Part 107 certified. Drone cyber payload research (TraceLock), 3D-printed RF housings, modular system design. Cross-domain problem solving.
<span class="tag-chip">UAS</span> <span class="tag-chip">FAA 107</span> <span class="tag-chip">Innovation</span>
</div>

<div class="stat-tile" markdown>
**Business Operations**

<span class="tag-chip">Leadership</span> <span class="tag-chip">Client Work</span> <span class="tag-chip">Ops</span>
</div>
</div>

**Why this matters:** These adjacent skills make me more effective at GRC engineering. Python automation speeds up evidence collection. Homelab experience means I understand the systems I'm auditing. RF/detection work demonstrates logging architecture skills. DevOps knowledge enables policy-as-code approaches. Technical writing ensures audit-ready documentation.

**I'm not trying to be a jack-of-all-trades** — GRC engineering is the focus. But these capabilities make me a more valuable GRC engineer who can implement, automate, and document controls across diverse technical environments.
