</div>

<div class="feature-tile" markdown>
### :material-cloud-lock: &nbsp; Cloud Governance
Designing an AWS Control Pack with S3 default-deny, GuardDuty pipelines, and scoped IAM mapped to CIS/NIST.
</div>

<div class="feature-tile" markdown>
### :material-brain: &nbsp; AI-Assisted Workflows
Use LLM tools for accelerated policy drafting, control mapping, and documentation with rigorous human review.
</div>

</div>

**Bottom line:** I design the framework, build the architecture, and deliver audit-ready evidence.

## Detection engineering & offensive security

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**Current capability:** Active detection/IR lab with Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex, custom SIEM rules, and authored detections. TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry demonstrates detection engineering fundamentals across 6 wireless domains.

**Growth trajectory:** CySA+ and CSAP earned February 2026. PenTest+ pending. Building penetration testing portfolio through lab work and vulnerability assessments.

**Why this matters:** GRC engineers who understand offensive techniques write better controls. Detection experience informs what to log and monitor.

## AI-augmented security engineering

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**I build AI systems, not just use them.** CareerOS — the multi-agent system powering my job search — demonstrates production-grade prompt engineering, context management, and workflow orchestration.

**What I've built:**

- **GIAP™** — Production GRC automation platform with n8n workflows, webhook pipelines, and planned MCP integration for natural language compliance queries
- **TraceLock™** — Patent-pending RF threat detection with AI-assisted detection tuning and false positive reduction through pattern extraction
- **CareerOS** — 1,100+ line multi-agent system demonstrating production-grade prompt engineering, structured JSON schemas, and multi-model orchestration (Claude, GPT, Gemini)

**Why this matters for security roles:**

| Traditional Approach | AI-Augmented Approach |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Manual SIEM rule authoring | LLM-assisted detection content with human validation |
| Copy-paste policy templates | Structured prompt → consistent, auditable output |
| Spreadsheet control mapping | AI-driven cross-framework mapping at scale |
| Ad-hoc documentation | Living docs generated from structured schemas |

**Skills:** Prompt Engineering · Multi-Agent Orchestration · Context Management · Structured Output Design · AI-Assisted Code Review · MCP Protocol

## AAM cybersecurity specialization

**I don't just secure drones — I've designed, built, and fielded UAV systems.**

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) security requires practitioners who understand the engineering, not just the vulnerabilities. I bring hands-on experience across the full lifecycle:

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **UAV Engineering** | Designed, built, and fielded operational UAV systems |
| **USPTO Patents** | Granted patents in UAV payload and delivery architectures |
| **RF Threat Detection** | TraceLock™ 6-domain correlation (Wi-Fi/BLE/SDR/GPS/ADS-B) — rogue APs, trackers, drone proximity |
| **Aviation Credentials** | FAA Part 107 certified drone pilot |
| **SDR/Wireless** | HackRF, RTL-SDR, Kismet — spectrum analysis and signal intelligence |
| **Consulting** | AAM Cyber, LLC — cyber-physical security services |
| **Military Aviation** | USAF aeromedical operations background |
