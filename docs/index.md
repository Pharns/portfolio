# Pharns Genece

**GRC Engineer · Cloud Security · Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Cybersecurity**

I build audit-ready control frameworks, evidence pipelines, and compliance automation — then implement the technical controls, not just document them. Rare hybrid: GRC discipline meets RF/aviation security and cyber-physical systems expertise. AI-augmented delivery at 10× capacity.

**Targeting:** GRC Engineer · Cloud Security Engineer · AAM/UAV Security · Detection Engineering · Cyber-Physical Systems

## Why hire me for GRC engineering

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**I implement the controls, not just document them.**

Most GRC professionals write policies and manage spreadsheets. I architect and build the technical systems that satisfy those controls:

- **Cloud governance** — Built AWS Control Pack with S3 default-deny, GuardDuty export pipelines, scoped IAM roles, and CIS/NIST mapping. Can deploy production-ready cloud baselines in hours.

- **Endpoint compliance** — Delivered PCI-DSS Windows 11 hardening (BitLocker, GPO, firewall rules, patch automation, EDR) with complete evidence pack in <48 hours. Know how to actually secure endpoints, not just check boxes.

- **Compliance automation** — Architected GIAP™ intake platform: Nextcloud + n8n workflows + SuiteCRM with RBAC, retention policies, consent management, and structured JSON outputs. Automated what others do manually.

- **Evidence pipelines** — Built TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry system with audit-grade logging, structured schemas, and evidence export workflows. Same skills used for cloud logs, access controls, and compliance data.

- **Detection & response** — Operate active Security Onion + TheHive/Cortex lab. Author SIEM rules, tune false positives, write IR playbooks. Understand security operations, not just governance.

- **AI-augmented delivery** — Use multi-agent LLM workflows to draft policies, map controls, and generate documentation at 10× speed with human review. Deliver in hours what takes others weeks.

**Bottom line:** Hire me if you need someone who can design a control framework, implement the technical architecture, document everything with evidence, and hand auditors a clean package — all while working at AI-augmented velocity.

## Detection engineering & offensive security

<div class="section-panel" markdown>

**Current capability:** Active detection/IR lab with Security Onion, TheHive/Cortex, custom SIEM rules, and authored detections. TraceLock™ RF/SDR telemetry demonstrates detection engineering fundamentals across 6 wireless domains.

**Growth trajectory:** CySA+ and PenTest+ scheduled December 2025. Building penetration testing portfolio through lab work and vulnerability assessments.

**Why this matters:** GRC engineers who understand offensive techniques write better controls. Detection experience informs what to log and monitor.

## AAM cybersecurity specialization

**I don't just secure drones — I've designed, built, and fielded UAV systems.**

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) security requires practitioners who understand the engineering, not just the vulnerabilities. I bring hands-on experience across the full lifecycle:

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **UAV Engineering** | Designed, built, and fielded operational UAV systems |
| **USPTO Patents** | Granted patents in UAV payload and delivery architectures |
| **RF Threat Detection** | TraceLock™ with ADS-B integration for drone surveillance detection |
| **Aviation Credentials** | FAA Part 107 certified drone pilot |
| **SDR/Wireless** | HackRF, RTL-SDR, Kismet — spectrum analysis and signal intelligence |
| **Consulting** | AAM Cyber, LLC — cyber-physical security services |
| **Military Aviation** | USAF aeromedical operations background |
