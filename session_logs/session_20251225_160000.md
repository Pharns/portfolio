## Key Decisions

### AAM Positioning Strategy
**Decision:** Strengthen AAM (Advanced Air Mobility) positioning throughout the portfolio to target aerospace and defense cybersecurity roles.

**Rationale:**
- User has unique builder-to-defender narrative (built AAM drones, now secures them)
- Differentiates from generic cybersecurity portfolios
- Aligns with high-value industry growth area

**Implementation:**
- Added AAM section to About page
- Added AAM callout to homepage hero
- Highlighted LoRa/Meshtastic RF research
- Prepared ground for dedicated AAM case study (pending)

### ATS Optimization
**Decision:** Add structured, keyword-rich skills snapshot to About page.

**Rationale:**
- Improves ATS parsing
- Provides quick-scan value for recruiters
- Highlights certification acronyms (searchable keywords)

**Implementation:**
- Created three-column grid: Hard Skills, Soft Skills, Certifications
- Used bullet points for easy parsing
- Added to About page after role hierarchy section

### Quantified Metrics
**Decision:** Add "Results at a glance" section to homepage with specific numbers.

**Rationale:**
- Expert review identified missing quantification
- Numbers provide immediate credibility
- Demonstrates business impact, not just technical skills

**Metrics Added:**
- 98% compliance achievement (PCI-DSS)
- 40+ vulnerability remediation
- 100% business continuity (IR plan)
- 300 consecutive days of Python learning
